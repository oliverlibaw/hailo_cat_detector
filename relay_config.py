Important configuration notes:
1. The 'left' relay should move the camera/gun to the LEFT
2. The 'right' relay should move the camera/gun to the RIGHT
3. If movements are reversed, swap the pin numbers for 'left' and 'right'
4. Most relay HATs are active-low (relay activates when GPIO pin is set LOW)
5. The squirt relay may have different behavior than the movement relays
6. Higher PD_CENTER_THRESHOLD gives more stability but less accuracy
7. Higher PD_MOVEMENT_COOLDOWN prevents oscillation but slows response
8. Set CONFIGURATION_VERIFIED to True once testing confirms correct operation
